0.02    2015-11-19 (PERLANCAR)

        - Upgrade dependencies of benchmarked modules from RuntimeRecommends to
          RuntimeRequires because we need them when running benchmark in
          testing.

        - Add TestRequires prereq to Bencher, add test files t/bench-*.t to run
          benchmarks during testing.


0.01    2015-11-18 (PERLANCAR)

        - First, early release. Currently what it does is just add the
          benchmarked modules to RuntimeRecommends.
